Inventory turnover is a critical efficiency ratio that measures how many times inventory is sold or used in a given period.

This metric is particularly useful for identifying items that might become slow-moving or obsolete if their days of supply are consistently high without corresponding demand."

Turnover provides a historical view of sales efficiency. Stockout Rate highlights past and present service level issues. Days of Supply offers a forward-looking perspective on inventory sufficiency. Together, these metrics enable proactive inventory management, helping to optimize stock levels, reduce carrying costs, minimize stockouts, and improve overall supply chain performance. For instance, an item with low turnover but high days of supply might be flagged as a slow-mover, while an item with a high stockout rate despite seemingly adequate days of supply could indicate demand volatility or supply chain disruptions."
